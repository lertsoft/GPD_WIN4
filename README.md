<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an set of instruction or checklist of sorts for me to follow once I get my device. I will do two different ones because I will be doing a fresh install of windows on a new SSD, and the included SSD will be left for trouble-shooting.

> for those of us that would love to 3D print some accesories. </br>
***[3D model file](https://github.com/lertsoft/GPD_WIN4/releases/tag/v0.1.1-3DModel)***

### Test your Hardware 
1. Test gpu under load, look for black screens. (Use graphically instensive software. ie. AAA games, 3dmark, photoshop, etc.)
    * [ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ GPU STRESS TEST SOFTWARE ðŸš¨ðŸš¨](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/)
2. Check bios version (Only update if necessary, see #1 ^^ Above ^^)
3. Test all keyboard keys and buttons.
4. Test all the ports. 
    * USB C 4 - Top. Should charge and transmit up to 40 Gbps.
    * USB A 3.2 - Top. Should transmit up to 10 Gbps.
    * USB C 3.2 - Bottom. Should charge and transmit up to 10 Gbps.
5. Test the micro sd card slot. Look for disconnecting and reconnecting issues, be patience as this might take a day or two of using the slot to notice any unexpected behavior.
4. Test analog deadzones and update firmware if needed
6. [Look for dead pixels](https://www.jscreenfix.com/fix.html)
7. Test the Touch screen for deadzones. (dragging your finger across the entire screen could help finding any)
8. Test the small touchpad ( if it doesn't work or is not working properly update firmware)
9. Look for any gaps on the devices.
    * Check the seams between the top shell and bottom shell.
    * Check for gaps between the screen and the screen holder.
    * Check for more than normal gaps between the sliding screen and keyboard, (According to [GPD](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-4-smallest-6800u-handheld-console#/updates/22) 0.1~0.3mm variation is acceptable tolerance)
10. [Test your analog stick circularity](https://gamepad-tester.com).
11. Make sure your keycaps, top and bottom shell does not have any cracks.
12. Do a full malware scan, or reinstall OS.
13. [Stress Test Your CPU ](https://www.mersenne.org/download/)
</br>

**ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ALL THIS ISSUES REPORTS ARE FROM GPD DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS IE. CHINAðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨** </BR>
**ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENT HAS NOT STARTED YETðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨**

### Known Issues

> Basically all issues that have been found in the initial stages will be solved, unless there is a severe design/hardware bug, and so far GPD have not gotten such report (and there is a high probability that there will not be such report in the future too) </br> [YYang - GPD REP Statement](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1077842038403379272)

> These are the major issues that GPD is aware of and working on as of 02/19/2023: **right, and left trigger buttons have a bubble inside**,  and **The right stick and right trigger shaking issue**. </br> **BOTH OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN SOLVED IN NEWER BATCHES** </br>
[YYang - GPD REP Statement](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1077046911888015361)

> These are the major issues that GPD is aware of and working on as of 02/28/2023: **right trigger spring is stuck and/or make noises**,  and **the screen gap isn't symmetrical**. </br>

> These are the major issues that GPD is aware of and working on as of 03/01/2023: **The screen gap isn't symmetrical, the left side gap is bigger**, **right trigger spring is stuck and/or make noises**,  and **Pixel point on screen**. </br>
[Kendyz - GPD REP Statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/11ex280/the_topic_collection/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

``` ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ If there is a solution to any of these issues they will be under that issue! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ ``` </br>
``` ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ If GPD knows of solved those issues I will mentioned that next to the issue or it will be crossed out! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ ```

#### Screen related issues
* **~~Uneven screen~~** </br> So far it seen that GPD has improved the tolerance of the screen uneven-ness. So this will be less of an issue on newer batches </br> ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/950574522011119707/1078522664861323304/image.png) </br> </br> ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/950574522011119707/1076400368541511700/91CA6DD6-B862-4C0F-8695-165E98A45B36.jpg)
* **Screen is showing artifacts or random pixels.** </br> The screen is showing some pixels? or some artifacts when you use the touchscreen. </br> [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/11cpjdy/screen_corruption_hw_or_just_swdriversettings/) </br> [YYang - GPD REP Statement](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1079599746810916924)  </br> GPD Already knows of the issue is working on fixing it. 
* **~~The touch input is not the same as the register input.~~** </br> The screen is not inputting the right spot of where it was touch. You press in a area the but the input is register in a different area of the screen. </br> [reddit poost](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/11bvgqc/saw_this_video_is_the_touchscreen_issue_a_hw_fw/) </br> [YYang - GPD REP statement](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1079598944134365214) </br> GPD knows of this issue but don't know yet if it is hardware or software. And the reports are from a small amount of people. </br> THIS ISSUES SEEMS TO BE FIXED WITH THE NEWER DRIVERS. </br> [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1080676813510021271).

#### Cosmetic related issues
* **~~Left / right trigger have a bubble inside.~~** </br> FIXED ON NEWER BATCHES! </br> ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/950574522011119707/1076776794650325002/image_editor_1676793804600.jpg)

#### Other hardware issues
* **~~SD Card slot might be too deep??~~** </br> Ejecting a SD card can be tricky because the card is too deep inside the pc to easily retrieved with finger. The user had to use a little stick to get it to eject. </br> IT SEEMS THIS WAS FIXED IN NEWER BATCHES. </br> [Discord Post](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1080425585391714405)
* **When sliding the screen the keyboard register a key press**. </br> GPD seem to be aware of the issue. As kendys a GPD Rep commented on the post. </br> [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/11dr5hd/a_few_reports_of_the_o_key_getting_pressed_when/) 
* **~~Analog stick rotates a little, Screen could make a tap sound, and mouse input not working as intented~~**. </br> GPD has updated the drivers for win 4 so that the mouse works as intended [message link](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1080667865075687497), the stick rotation is to be expected according to GPD as the stick is removable, and GPD has improved QC so that the screen tap sound does not happen again. </br> [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/11d8gej/my_win4s_problem_round_2/)
* **~~Compilation of most of the early issues in one video~~**. </br> MOST OF THESE ISSUES HAS BEEN FIXED IN NEWER BATCHES. </br> [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/116y8ww/domestic_beta_testers_working_hard_doing_qc_i/)

### Useful Information

[GPD WIN4 Manual](Manuals/GPD_WIN4_User_Mannual.pdf)

***Changing the iGPU vRAM allocation***
> Note: The ram on the GPD Win 4 is shared meaning that the 16GB or 32GB of RAM of the device will go to both the CPU and GPU which could hamper performance of the devices depending on the configuration. The recommended amount of vRAM is 4GB for the 16GB RAM model, and 8GB for the 32GB RAM model.

1. Enter BIOS by holding the DEL key during boot
2. Go to "Advanced" tab
3. Go to "GFX Configuration"
4. Change "UMA Frame buffer Size" to desired value, the recommended value is 4GB for the 16GB RAM model, and 8GB for the 32GB RAM model.
5. Press ESC and go to "Save & Exit" tab
6. Select "Save Changes and Exit" and select "Yes"

> ***btprice2001*** shared this images on the discord to show the difference between difference vRAM allocations at different TDP's.
