<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an set of instruction or checklist of sorts for me to follow once I get my device. I will do two different ones because I will be doing a fresh install of windows on a new SSD, and the included SSD will be left for trouble-shooting.

> for those of us that would love to 3D print some accesories. </br>
***[3D model file](https://github.com/lertsoft/GPD_WIN4/releases/tag/v0.1.1-3DModel)*** </br>
***[Shoulder Buttons - L & R](https://github.com/lertsoft/GPD_WIN4/releases/tag/v0.1.1-3DModel)*** </br>
***[Trigger Buttons](https://github.com/lertsoft/GPD_WIN4/releases/tag/v0.1.1-3DModel)*** </br>
***[Grip Case](https://github.com/lertsoft/GPD_WIN4/releases/tag/0.1.3D-Model)***

**ðŸš¨ðŸš¨WARNING!ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ PLEASE IF YOU PLAN ON DOING A FRESH INSTALL I WOULD SUGGEST NOT USING APPS SUCHS AS DRIVEREASY, OR CCLEANER AS THOSE APPS WILL FIND THE LATEST DRIVERS BUT THOSE DRIVERS COULD BE FOR A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DEVICE, SUCH AS AYANEO WHICH HAS A PORTRAIT SCREEN, AND COULD CAUSE SCREEN ISSUES!  [THANKS TO N1CKN4M3 FOR BRINGING THIS POINT](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1090989111642423306)ðŸš¨ðŸš¨**

### Test your Hardware 
1. Test gpu under load, look for black screens. (Use graphically instensive software. ie. AAA games, 3dmark, photoshop, etc.)
    * [ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ GPU STRESS TEST SOFTWARE ðŸš¨ðŸš¨](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/)
2. Check bios version (Only update if necessary, see #1 ^^ Above ^^)
3. Test all keyboard keys and buttons.
4. Test all the ports. 
    * USB C 4 - Top. Should charge and transmit up to 40 Gbps.
    * USB A 3.2 - Top. Should transmit up to 10 Gbps.
    * USB C 3.2 - Bottom. Should charge and transmit up to 10 Gbps.
    * [Crystal Disk Mark can be used to test storage speeds on all the  ports including MicroSD slot](https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskmark/)
5. Test the micro sd card slot. Look for disconnecting and reconnecting issues, have patience as this might take a day or two of using the slot to notice any unexpected behavior. </br> If testing Micro SD card slot speed make sure you use UHS-I cards and not UHS-II. The GPD Win4 does not utilize the second row pins of UHS-II. <details>

4. Test analog deadzones and update firmware if needed. [GAMEPAD TESTER](https://gamepad-tester.com).
6. [Look for dead pixels](https://www.jscreenfix.com/fix.html)
7. Test the Touch screen for deadzones. (dragging your finger across the entire screen could help finding any)
8. Test the small touchpad ( if it doesn't work or is not working properly update firmware)
9. Look for any gaps on the devices.
    * Check the seams between the top shell and bottom shell.
    * Check for gaps between the screen and the screen holder.
    * Check for more than normal gaps between the sliding screen and keyboard, (According to [GPD](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-4-smallest-6800u-handheld-console#/updates/22) 0.1~0.3mm variation is acceptable tolerance)
10. [Test your analog stick circularity](https://gamepad-tester.com).
11. Make sure your keycaps, top and bottom shell does not have any cracks.
12. Do a full malware scan, or reinstall OS.
13. [STRESS TEST YOUR CPU](https://www.mersenne.org/download/)

#### Screen related issues
* **~~Uneven screen~~** </br> So far it seen that GPD has improved the tolerance of the screen uneven-ness. So this will be less of an issue on newer batches </br> ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/950574522011119707/1078522664861323304/image.png) </br> </br> ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/950574522011119707/1076400368541511700/91CA6DD6-B862-4C0F-8695-165E98A45B36.jpg)

#### Other hardware issues
* **~~SD Card slot might be too deep??~~** </br> Ejecting a SD card can be tricky because the card is too deep inside the pc to easily retrieved with finger.

### Useful Information

[GPD WIN4 Manual](Manuals/GPD_WIN4_User_Mannual.pdf)

***Booting from a USB Drive***
* Hold Shift + FN + 7 
</br>

***Changing the iGPU vRAM allocation***
> Note: The ram on the GPD Win 4 is shared meaning that the 16GB or 32GB of RAM of the device will go to both the CPU and GPU which could hamper performance of the devices depending on the configuration. The recommended amount of vRAM is 4GB for the 16GB RAM model, and 8GB for the 32GB RAM model.

1. Enter BIOS by holding the DEL key during boot
2. Go to "Advanced" tab
3. Go to "CBS" tab
4. Go to "NBIO" tab
5. Go to "GFX Configuration"
6. Change "UMA Frame buffer Size" to desired value, the recommended value is 4GB for the 16GB RAM model, and 8GB for the 32GB RAM model.
7. Press ESC and go to "Save & Exit" tab
8. Select "Save Changes and Exit" and select "Yes"

> ***btprice2001*** shared this images on the discord to show the difference between difference vRAM allocations at different TDP's.

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->
## Troubleshooting

- **USB A speeds are not as advertised** </br>
   > If after testing your USB A port your speeds are not up to the standard of USB 3.2 and your device has speeds close to USB 2 than 3 then this could be a temporary solution / workaround. Thanks to **DesignGears** on Discord [Message Link](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1086042020528787566) :) 
  
  1. Connect a USB A to USB Hub. Test.
  2. If it didn't work check windows device manager, and USBDeview and see if the devices are there with the specified spec ie. USB 3.2
  3. If it didn't work check for latest drivers ie. GPD, AMD Adrenalin, Windows, ETC. 
  4. If it didn't work test on linux.
  5. if it didn't work reset BIOS, using the little pin hole on the side.
  6. If it didn't work check that your device internals is correctly connected.
  7. If none of this steps worked check-in with GPD support, because that might be faulty a parts.
  
  **DesignGears** tests screenshoots of before and after the fix / workaround.

- **TouchScreen is not working** </br>
   > If you used an SSD or SD Card from another device and that storage device had the screen drivers from a different device ie. Ayaneo, Steamdeck, etc. </br> It could turned the screen in a portrait orientation, cause touchscreen, and/or panel issues on the GPD Win4. If you run into these issues follow this steps. Thanks to **DesignGears** on Discord [Message Link](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/950574522011119707/1090683247329030247) :) 
  
  1. [Download the new driver for the screen.](https://github.com/lertsoft/GPD_WIN4/releases/tag/v5.1)
  2. Install the drivers
  3. Restart the device
  4. The issue should be fixed.
  5. If not. Send a message to kendyz or ask a question on discord or here.
  
- **The touch input is not the same as the register input** </br>
   > This issue could have been cause because of the use of the DriverEasy, or CCleaner apps to update drivers. </br> After a fresh installation the screen is not inputting the right spot of where it was touch.
